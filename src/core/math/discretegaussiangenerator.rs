/*
  This code provides generation of gaussian distributions of discrete values. Discrete uniform generator
  relies on the built-in C++ generator for 32-bit unsigned integers defined in <random>
*/

/**
 * This is the header file for DiscreteGaussianGenerator class, which contains 3
 * different sampling methods.
 *
 * First sampling method implemented is the rejection sampling defined in
 * section 4.1 of https://eprint.iacr.org/2007/432.pdf. It is usable for
 * arbitrary centers and standard deviations, and does not require any form of
 * precomputation. However, it has high rejection rates and is prone to timing
 * attacks. It is not used anywhere in the library at the moment and is here for
 * historical reasons.
 *
 * Second sampling method implemented is Karney's method defined in Algorithm D
 * from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.6257.pdf, which is an improved method based
 * on rejection sampling. It also works for arbitrary centers and standard
 * deviations without any precomputation. Its rejection rate is smaller than in
 * the rejection sampling method but it may still be vulnerable to timing
 * attacks.
 *
 *
 * Final sampling method defined in this class is the Peikert's inversion method
 * discussed in section 4.1 of https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/088.pdf and
 * summarized in section 3.2.2 of
 * https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00200-014-0218-3.pdf. It
 * requires CDF tables of probabilities centered around single center to be
 * kept, which are precalculated in constructor. The method is not prone to
 * timing attacks but it is usable for single center, single deviation only.
 * It should be also noted that the memory requirement grows with the standard
 * deviation, therefore it is advised to use it with smaller deviations.   */
